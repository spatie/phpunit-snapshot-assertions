> Snapshot testing is a way to test without writing actual test cases

```php
use Spatie\Snapshots\MatchesSnapshots;

class OrderTest
{
    use MatchesSnapshot;

    class test_it_casts_to_json()
    {
        $order = new Order(1);

        $this->assertMatchesJsonSnapshot($order->toJson());
    }
}
```

On the first run, the test runner will create a new snapshot.

```
> ./vendor/bin/phpunit

There was 1 incomplete test:

1) OrderTest::test_it_casts_to_json
Snapshot created for OrderTest__test_it_casts_to_json__1

OK, but incomplete, skipped, or risky tests!
Tests: 1, Assertions: 0, Incomplete: 1.
```

On subsequent runs, the test will pass as long as the snapshot doesn't change.

```
> ./vendor/bin/phpunit

OK (1 test, 1 assertion)
```

If there's a regression, the test will fail!

```php
$orderId = new Order(2); // Regression! Was `1`
```
```
> ./vendor/bin/phpunit

1) OrderTest::test_it_casts_to_json
Failed asserting that two strings are equal.
--- Expected
+++ Actual
@@ @@
Failed asserting that '{"id":2}' matches JSON string "{
    "id": 1
}

FAILURES!
Tests: 1, Assertions: 1, Failures: 1.
```

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/phpunit-snapshot-assertions
```

## Usage

To make snapshot assertions, use the `Spatie\Snapshots\MatchesSnapshots` trait in your test case class. This adds four assertion methods to the class:

- `assertMatchesSnapshot($actual)`
- `assertMatchesJsonSnapshot($actual)`
- `assertMatchesXmlSnapshot($actual)`
- `assertMatchesFileHashSnapshot($filePath)`

### Snapshot Testing 101

Let's do a snapshot assertion for a simple string, "foo".

```php
public function test_it_is_foo() {
    $this->assertMatchesSnapshot('foo');
}
```

The first time the assertion runs, it doesn't have a snapshot to compare the string with. The test runner generates a new snapshot and marks the test as incomplete.

```
> ./vendor/bin/phpunit

There was 1 incomplete test:

1) ExampleTest::test_it_matches_a_string
Snapshot created for ExampleTest__test_it_matches_a_string__1

OK, but incomplete, skipped, or risky tests!
Tests: 1, Assertions: 0, Incomplete: 1.
```

Snapshot ids are generated based on the test and testcase's names. Basic snapshots return a `var_export` of the actual value.

```php
<?php return 'foo';
```

Let's rerun the test. The test runner will see that there's already a snapshot for the assertion and do a comparison.

```
> ./vendor/bin/phpunit

OK (1 test, 1 assertion)
```

If we change actual value to "bar", the test will fail because the snapshot still returns "foo".

```php
public function test_it_is_foo() {
    $this->assertMatchesSnapshot('bar');
}
```
```
> ./vendor/bin/phpunit

1) ExampleTest::test_it_matches_a_string
Failed asserting that two strings are equal.
--- Expected
+++ Actual
@@ @@
-'foo'
+'bar'

FAILURES!
Tests: 1, Assertions: 1, Failures: 1.
```

When we expect a changed value, we need to tell the test runner to update the existing snapshots instead of failing the test. This is possible by adding  a`-d --update-snapshots` flag to the `phpunit` command.

```
> ./vendor/bin/phpunit -d --update-snapshots

OK (1 test, 1 assertion)
```

As a result, our snapshot file returns "bar" instead of "foo".

```php
<?php return 'bar';
```

### Customizing Snapshot Ids and Directories

Snapshot ids are generated via the `getSnapshotId` method on the `MatchesSnapshot` trait. Override the method to customize the id. By default, a snapshot id exists of the test name, the test case name and an incrementing value, e.g. `Test__my_test_case__1`.

#### Example: Replacing the `__` Delimiter With `--`

```php
protected function getSnapshotId(): string
{
    return (new ReflectionClass($this))->getShortName().'--'.
        $this->getName().'--'.
        $this->snapshotIncrementor;
}
```

By default, snapshots are stored in a `__snapshots__` directory relative to the test class. This can be changed by overriding the `getSnapshotDirectory` method.

#### Example: Renaming the `__snapshots__` directory to `snapshots`

```php
protected function getSnapshotDirectory(): string
{
    return dirname((new ReflectionClass($this))->getFileName()).
        DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.
        'snapshots';
}
```

### Writing Custom Drivers

Drivers ensure that different types of data can be serialized and matched in their own way. A driver is a class that implements the `Spatie\Snapshots\Driver` interface, which requires three method implementations: `serialize`, `extension` and `match`.

Let's take a quick quick look at the `JsonDriver`.

```php
namespace Spatie\Snapshots\Drivers;

use PHPUnit\Framework\Assert;
use Spatie\Snapshots\Driver;
use Spatie\Snapshots\Exceptions\CantBeSerialized;

class JsonDriver implements Driver
{
    public function serialize($data): string
    {
        if (! is_string($data)) {
            throw new CantBeSerialized('Only strings can be serialized to json');
        }

        return json_encode(json_decode($data), JSON_PRETTY_PRINT).PHP_EOL;
    }

    public function extension(): string
    {
        return 'json';
    }

    public function match($expected, $actual, string $message = '')
    {
        Assert::assertJsonStringEqualsJsonString($expected, $actual, $message);
    }
}
```

- The `serialize` method returns a string which will be written to the snapshot file. In the `JsonDriver`, we'll decode and re-encode the json string to ensure the snapshot has pretty printing.
- We want to save json snapshots as json files, so we'll use `json` as their file extension.
- When matching the expected data with the actual data, we want to use PHPUnit's built in json assertions, so we'll call the specific `assertJsonStringEqualsJsonString` method.

Drivers can be used by passing them as `assertMatchesSnapshot`'s second argument.

```php
$this->assertMatchesSnapshot($something->toYaml(), new MyYamlDriver());
```
